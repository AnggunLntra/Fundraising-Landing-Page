Practice implementing the design of the dribble

## About 
In this exercise, I'm trying to implement a fundraising landing page design that I got from the dribble site.
There are 4 sections on the fundraising direction page, namely:
- About us, which explains the mission and history
- Our program, which explains about 4 programs in an effort to love the ocean and our appeals
- Our stories, which contain reviews from partners
- Donate and Join

In this exercise I use the bootstrap 5 css framework. The backgrounds and vectors that I use come from freepik and flaticon.

In order to customize the view to suit the design, I also created some additional classes. I wrote the new style in the style tag and some in the tag line.

In implementing the design there were several obstacles that I experienced, namely:
- The difficulty of finding assets that match the design.
- Oversized padding when on small screen sizes

The solutions I can do are:
- Search for assets that are close or similar to the assets used in the landing page design
- Created a new class to set padding
